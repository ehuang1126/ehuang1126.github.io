        I used the following photos for this project. Corresponding pictures were taken from the same location.

    <h3>
        Recovering Homographies
    </h3>
    <p>
        To recover the homographies between images, I first hand-defined several corresponding points on several images. 
        I then used these correspondences to derive the 8 variables in the transformation matrix. This involved rearranging the 
        transformation equation. By using more than 4 pairs of corresponding points, we have an overdetermined system, so I used the least squares solution to the system. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        Image Warping
    </h3>
    <p>
        To warp images into the perspective of other images, I used inverse warping and linear interpolation, similar to the previous project. 
        I first calculated the homographies between images and applied this transformation on the corners to determine the shape of the resulting warped image. From there,
        I used inverse warping and interpolated pixel values from the original, unwarped image. The final image is translated to avoid having any negative pixel coordinates. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        Image Rectification
    </h3>
    <p>
        To verify the correctness of the previous two functions, I warped various images into their rectified viewing angles:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Original
            </th>
            <th>
                Rectified
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="media/keyboard.jpg" alt="keyboard">
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="media/keyboard_rect.jpg" alt="keyboard rect">
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="media/poster.jpg" alt="poster">

        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>
        Image Mosaics
    </h3>
    <p>
        Finally, I used the warping function to generate mosaic images. To align images, I applied the translation from the image warping to the unwarped image. 
        To blend the overlapping areas of the images, I utilized a weighted average based on the distance transform of each image. Specifically, pixels in the overlapping area are weighted by their 
        relative distance from the non-overlapping areas of the original images. This helps to avoid any seams between images. Images that have more extreme transformations are cropped to avoid extremely large mosaics.

        4B: Feature Matching for Autostitching 
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Detecting Corner Features
    </h3>
    <p>
        I used the provided Harris detector to find Harris corners in images. This uses a single-scale implementation and thresholds were manually 
        selected for each image based on testing. For this image, I used a threshold of 0.03, resulting in around 2000 Harris corner points. 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Adaptive Non-maximal Suppresion
    </h3>
    <p>
        To find points with stronger corner values, I used adaptive non-maximal suppresion (ANMS) to filter the interest points. This chooses interest points 
        by only selecting points that are local maxima within a given pixel radius. This helps to give points that are strong corners more uniformly distributed across the image. 
        My implementation iteratively reduces this radius until a target number of points is 
        reached or the radius is smaller than a user-defined minimum. These two parameters are selected through testing depending on the image. For the room image, 
        ANMS chooses about 500 of the strongest interest points from the original 2000. 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Feature Descriptor Extraction
    </h3>
    <p>
        In order to find corresponding interest points between images, we need some descriptor for each interest point. For this project, I used an axis-aligned feature descriptor. 
        To do this, I applied a Gaussian blur to a 40x40 pixel window around each interest point, downsampling them to 8x8 windows. These features can then be used to compare interest points
        across images. 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Feature Matching
    </h3>
    <p>
        Now that we have interest points and feature descriptors, we can compare interest points to find corresponding points across images to define homographies. I found matching points by using Lowe's trick. For each point in 
        one image, I found the ratio of similarity with the 1-NN and the 2-NN. Only points with a ratio below a certain threshold are selected. The logic here is that points that are strong matches should be 
        significantly more similar to their first nearest neighbor than the next nearest neighbor. Using a threshold of 0.4, this left 59 pairs of corresponding points for the room images:

    <h3>
        Defining Robust Homographies using RANSAC
    </h3>
    <p>
        Clearly, there are still some outlier points (see the artwork in the right image, which isn't even in frame for the left image). 
        To help mitigate the effect of these outliers, I used Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) to define more robust homographies. This involves iteratively randomly sampling 4 pairs of corresponding points, computing a 
        homography from these 4 correspondences, and tracking the number of inliers. The homography with the most inliers is then selected and a final homography is calculated using these inliers.

    <h3>
        Takeaways
    </h3>
    <p>
        I was quite careful when manually selecting corresponding points, so there is not much of a difference between the manual and automatic mosaics. 
        This was a very interesting application of linear algebra to images and I found the techniques for mitigating outliers (ANMS, RANSAC, Lowe's trick, etc.) very satisfying.
